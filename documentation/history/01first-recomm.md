# System Requirements & Technology Stack: "Playlists"

This document outlines the recommended system architecture, technology stack, and requirements for the "Playlists" web application.

## 1. Recommended System Architecture

The application will be designed using a modern, decoupled architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns.

*   **Frontend (Client-Side):** A Single-Page Application (SPA) will be developed to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience. It will communicate with the backend exclusively through a RESTful API.
*   **Backend (Server-Side):** A monolithic REST API service will serve as the application's core. It will handle all business logic, including user management, playlist CRUD operations, and interaction with the database. It will also be responsible for communicating with external music service APIs (e.g., YouTube, SoundCloud) to fetch song metadata.
*   **Database:** A relational database will be used to persist all application data, including user profiles, playlists, and song information.
*   **Deployment:** The entire application stack (frontend, backend, database) will be containerized using Docker. This allows for consistent environments from development to production and simplifies deployment on any cloud provider or self-hosted infrastructure.



## 2. Detailed Technology Stack

### Frontend

*   **Framework:** **React** (v18+)
*   **Language:** **TypeScript**
*   **Build Tool:** **Vite** for a fast development experience and optimized builds.
*   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first CSS workflow.
*   **State Management:**
    *   **React Context API** for simple, global state.
    *   **@preact/signals-react** for fine-grained reactivity as requested.
*   **Routing:** **React Router** for client-side navigation.
*   **Data Fetching:** **Axios** or `TanStack Query` for robust data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
*   **Testing:** **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and component testing.

### Backend

*   **Framework:** **Spring Boot** (v3.x)
*   **Language:** **Java** (LTS version, e.g., 17 or 21)
*   **API Style:** **REST**
*   **Authentication:** **Spring Security** with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for stateless authentication.
*   **Database Access:** **Spring Data JPA** with **Hibernate** for object-relational mapping.
*   **Build Tool:** **Maven** or **Gradle**.
*   **API Documentation:** **SpringDoc OpenAPI** to automatically generate Swagger UI documentation.
*   **Testing:** **JUnit 5**, **Mockito**, and **Testcontainers** for unit and integration testing.

### Database

*   **System:** **PostgreSQL** (latest stable version)

### Deployment & DevOps

*   **Containerization:** **Docker**
*   **Orchestration (Local):** **Docker Compose** to define and run the multi-container application locally.
*   **CI/CD:** A platform like **GitHub Actions** can be used to automate testing and building Docker images.

## 3. System Requirements (Hardware/Cloud Resources)

These are initial estimates for a production environment designed to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users. Resources should be monitored and adjusted based on actual usage.

*   **Backend Server:**
    *   **Provider:** Any major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) or self-hosted.
    *   **Instance Type (Example):** General Purpose instance with 4 vCPUs and 16 GB RAM.
    *   **Scalability:** Run at least two instances behind a load balancer for high availability. Configure auto-scaling rules based on CPU utilization to handle traffic spikes.
*   **Database Server:**
    *   **Provider:** A managed database service is recommended (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL).
    *   **Instance Type (Example):** Instance with 2-4 vCPUs, 8-16 GB RAM, and sufficient SSD storage with provisioned IOPS.
    *   **Backup:** Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery enabled.
*   **Frontend Hosting:**
    *   Host the static frontend build on a CDN-backed service like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **AWS S3/CloudFront** for low-latency global delivery.

## 4. Security Best Practices Summary

Security will be a primary consideration throughout the development lifecycle.

*   **Secure Authentication:** Implement JWT-based authentication over HTTPS. Store hashed and salted passwords using a strong algorithm like **Bcrypt**.
*   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user input on both the frontend and backend to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQL Injection).
*   **OWASP Top 10 Mitigation:**
    *   Use Spring Security's built-in protections against CSRF.
    *   Use parameterized queries (provided by Spring Data JPA) to prevent SQL Injection.
    *   Configure appropriate security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Content-Type-Options).
*   **Data Encryption:**
    *   **In Transit:** Enforce **HTTPS** for all communication between the client, backend, and external APIs.
    *   **At Rest:** Utilize the encryption-at-rest features of your chosen cloud database provider. Encrypt sensitive application secrets (e.g., API keys, JWT secret) using a secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like **GitHub Dependabot** or **Snyk**.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the API to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service.
